        <h1 id="german">The Scientific Breakthroughs That Changed the World</h1>
        <p class="german">
          <b>First</b>, imagine a world without electricity, modern medicine, or
          the internet. Science has shaped humanity in ways we often take for
          granted. Some discoveries have completely transformed our
          understanding of the universe, improved our daily lives, and even
          saved millions of lives. <br />
          <b>Next</b>, let’s talk about penicillin, one of the most life-changing
          medical discoveries. In 1928, Alexander Fleming accidentally found
          that mold could kill bacteria. This discovery led to the development
          of antibiotics, revolutionizing medicine and saving countless lives.
          "I certainly didn’t plan to revolutionize medicine," Fleming once
          said, but his work changed history. <br />
          <b>In addition</b>, the discovery of DNA structure by James Watson and
          Francis Crick in 1953 was a turning point for genetics. Understanding
          DNA has led to advances in medicine, forensic science, and even
          personalized treatments. Scientists continue to explore the secrets of
          genetics, pushing the boundaries of knowledge. <br />
          <b> On the other hand</b>, space exploration has also given us
          incredible discoveries. When Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon in
          1969, he proved that humans could go beyond Earth. “That’s one small
          step for man, one giant leap for mankind,” he famously said. Since
          then, space research has helped us understand planets, black holes,
          and even the possibility of life beyond Earth. <br />
          <b>Finally</b>, scientific discoveries will continue to shape the
          future. Whether it's artificial intelligence, quantum computing, or
          climate solutions, scientists are always exploring new frontiers.
          Learning about these breakthroughs helps us appreciate the world
          around us and inspires future generations to continue making
          discoveries.

        <h1 id="karim">Sensational discovery: an ancient civilization has been found!</h1>
        <p class="karim">
          Deep in the Amazon jungle, where the sun barely breaks through the
          dense foliage, archaeologists have made an incredible discovery that
          could rewrite human history. <br />
          The newly discovered civilization, dubbed "Icarus," flourished between
          1000 and 1500 AD. Excavations conducted by an international team of
          archaeologists have revealed the remains of majestic temples, complex
          irrigation systems, and artifacts attesting to a high level of
          cultural development. <br />
          Everyone was amazed, as Icarus had a well-developed farming system, a
          complex social structure, and, apparently, deep knowledge in the field
          of astronomy." <br />
          Archaeologists have discovered ceramics, jewelry, and wall paintings
          depicting scenes from everyday life, religious rituals, and mysterious
          symbols that have yet to be deciphered.

        <h1 id="ruslan">The Town That Talked to Trees</h1>
        <p class="ruslan">
          Nobody believed that the quiet town of Zarechensk held such a secret
          until one day the ancient oak tree in the park began… to speak. <br />
          I've always been proud of Zarechensk, but my true pride came when our
          town became known for an extraordinary event. One morning, walking
          through the park, I heard a deep, resonating voice. "Good morning,
          young friend," the tree said. It was the old oak, the symbol of our
          town. <br> At first, I thought I was going crazy, but soon it turned out
          that other residents had also heard the oak's voice. It told stories
          about Zarechensk's past, about its founders, about the secrets hidden
          underground. "We, the trees, keep the memory of this place," the oak
          said. <br> Soon, scientists, linguists, and the simply curious flocked to
          Zarechensk. Everyone wanted to hear the tree's voice. This event
          united the townspeople. We began to appreciate our history and the
          surrounding nature more. The mayor of the city said, "Zarechensk has
          always been special, but now it has become unique." <br />
          Conclusion: Who knows what other secrets our cities hold? Maybe it's
          worth listening to the whisper of the wind in the foliage?
